# Document Searching and Ranking Using Suffix Trees
In order to find even a single word in a large takes so much of time if we tend to search all the substrings of the whole document. This can be easily done using suffix trees.First the suffix tree is made of the whole document using Ukkonen's Algorithm and then using dfs the substring can the find in very less time and also with the help of suffix tress we can also rank the documents according to the relevance of the string.
